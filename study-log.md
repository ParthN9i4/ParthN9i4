# FHE study log

The daily Routine (`Daily FHE fundamentals`, 14:27 UTC) reads this file as its **only**
memory of previous sessions. Append one entry per session, newest at the bottom, and push.
If the push fails the day is lost — see the note at the end.

Format for each entry:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — Chapter N: <title>
Exercise assigned: <tier>/<file>
Answers: <what was asked, what was right, what was wrong>
Weak spots: <specific, e.g. "confuses rescaling with modulus switching">
Revisit next time: <or "nothing">
```

## 2026-08-18 — log seeded, no session content

Created because the file was missing and every prior session had therefore begun at
Chapter 1 with no record. Nothing is known about which chapters have actually been
covered between 2026-08-07 and 2026-08-18, so the next session should **ask Parth what
he has already covered** rather than assuming Chapter 1, and record the answer here.

Reading order for reference: `fhe-book.html` has 28 chapters plus Appendices A–D.
Exercise pairing lives in `fhe-foundations/`: `tier0_math/ex01-05` for Chapters 1–5,
`tier1_ckks/ex06-09` for CKKS basics and depth limits, `tier2_engineering/ex10-12` for
OpenFHE level management and rotations, `tier3_ml/ex13-16` for encrypted ML and Chebyshev
activations, `tier4_fherma/ex17-18` for challenge preparation.

### If the push fails

This file is only useful if it is pushed. A session that cannot push must not end
quietly: it should say so plainly and send the updated log back through the chat so the
day's record survives outside the repository.

## 2026-08-21 — Chapter 1: Modular Arithmetic and Algebraic Structures
Exercise assigned: tier0_math/ex01_modular_arith.py (reference solutions present; task = blank and re-derive ntt(), watch the psi=2 rejection test and the schoolbook-convolution cross-check)
Answers: pending — three checking questions posed (RNS vs comparison; why omega^(N/2)=-1 is needed in the butterfly; discrete Gaussian vs bounded-uniform noise). Parth had not yet answered when the day's Routine fired.
Weak spots: unknown yet — first recorded session. Parth confirmed starting from Chapter 1 (no reliable coverage from the lost 2026-08-07..18 sessions).
Revisit next time: open with his answers to the three Ch1 questions before starting Chapter 2 (Polynomial Rings and Cyclotomic Fields).

## 2026-08-22 — Chapter 2: Polynomial Rings and Cyclotomic Fields
Exercise assigned: tier0_math/ex02_ring_poly.py (re-derive poly_mul_ntt; watch the negacyclic-wrap test and the random NTT-vs-schoolbook cross-check)
Answers: pending — 3 new questions (NTT domain vs plaintext slots; canonical vs coefficient norm; psi-twist sign mechanism). Ch1's 3 questions still open, carried forward.
Weak spots: none observable yet (no answers received in two sessions).
Revisit next time: all six open questions (Ch1 Q1-3, Ch2 Q1-3) before starting Ch3 (Lattices and Hard Problems).

## 2026-08-23 — Chapter 3: Lattices and Hard Problems
Exercise assigned: implement LLL from scratch (book Artifact 3.1) — verify reduced norms ~33.3/59.7 and det 1957 on bad basis [(1731,512),(1264,375)]. Note: ex03_lwe.py is Ch4 material, deferred to next session.
Answers: pending — day 3, no answers received. Nine questions open (Ch1 Q1-3, Ch2 Q1-3, Ch3 Q1-3).
Weak spots: none observable (no responses yet).
Revisit next time: if still no answers, pause new material and run a consolidated Ch1-3 review instead of teaching Ch4.

## 2026-08-24 — Consolidated review of Ch1-3 (no new chapter)
Exercise assigned: none new; invited pushing partial ex01/ex02/LLL work for code review.
Answers: pending, day 4. Nine open questions compressed into a six-item quick-reply check in chat.
Weak spots: engagement is the risk; no misconception observable yet.
Revisit next time: the six-item check. Resume Ch4 (LWE, ex03_lwe.py) once any answers arrive; if silence persists two more sessions, propose restructuring the format (weekly quiz / exercises-only / teach-only) before continuing.

## 2026-08-25 — Chapter 4: Learning With Errors
Exercise assigned: tier0_math/ex03_lwe.py (re-derive encrypt_lwe/decrypt_lwe; watch the 100/100 safe-regime test and the 39% broken-regime demo; try the wrong number-line decryption once deliberately)
Answers: pending — day 5 of silence. Open: six-item Ch1-3 consolidated check + Ch4 Q1-3.
Weak spots: none observable (no responses yet).
Revisit next time: all open items. If next session is also silent, propose format restructuring (weekly quiz / exercises-only / teach-only) before teaching Ch5 (Ring-LWE).
